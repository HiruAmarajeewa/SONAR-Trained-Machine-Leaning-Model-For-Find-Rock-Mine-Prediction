## 📊 Executive Summary 
The SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction project focuses on developing a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between rocks and mines using SONAR data. This contributes to improving object classification in water, impacting maritime navigation, safety, and defense through cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

## 🚀 Introduction 
### Background
SONAR technology plays a crucial role in underwater applications, making it essential to accurately classify objects at sea, such as rocks and mines.
### Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model for SONAR rock vs mine prediction.
- Improve accuracy and efficiency in distinguishing between rocks and mines.

## 🧠 Methodology 
### Data Collection
SONAR dataset imported to Pandas DataFrame, including SONAR readings and underwater object characteristics.
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
sonar_data = pd.read_csv('/SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction.csv', header=None)
```
### Machine Learning Model
Logistic regression model chosen for simplicity and understandability, trained on a subset of data, and evaluated for performance.
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Training the model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
```

## 💬 Discussion 
### Model Evaluation
The logistic regression model exhibited robust performance, achieving high accuracy in both training and test data. Ethical considerations were prioritized to ensure fair and transparent predictions.

## 🎉 Conclusion 
The project presents promising results in accurately classifying rocks and mines based on SONAR data. The developed model has implications for enhancing maritime navigation, safety, and defense, successfully achieving its objectives.
